				These are the words regarding the divisions of the times of the law and of the testimony, of the events of the
				years, of the weeks of their jubilees throughout all the years of eternity as he related (them) to Moses on Mt.
				Sinai when he went up to receive the stone tablets—the law and the commandments—on the Lord’s orders as he had told
				him that he should come up to the summit of the mountain.

	<chapter number="1" id="ch1">
		<paragraph status="onlyethiopic">
			<verse number="1">During the first year of the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt, in the third month—on the sixteenth
				of the month—the Lord said to Moses: “Come up to me on the mountain. I will give you the two stone tablets of the
				law and the commandments which I have written so that you may teach them.”</verse>
			<verse number="2">So Moses went up the mountain of the Lord. The glory of the Lord took up residence on Mt. Sinai,
				and a cloud covered it for six days. </verse>
			<verse number="3">When he summoned Moses into the cloud on the seventh day, he saw the glory of the Lord like a
				fire blazing on the summit of the mountain. </verse>
			<verse number="4">Moses remained on the mountain for 40 days and 40 nights while the Lord showed him what (had
				happened) beforehand as well as what was to come. He related to him the divisions of all the times—both of the law
				and of the testimony. </verse>
			<verse number="5">
				He said to him: “Pay attention to all the words which I tell you on this mountain. Write (them) in a book so that
				their offspring may see that I have not abandoned them because of all the evil they have done in
				<i>straying from </i>
				the covenant between me and you which I am making today on Mt. Sinai for their offspring.
			</verse>
			<verse number="6">So it will be that when all of these things befall them they will recognize that I have been
				more faithful than they in all their judgments and in all their actions. They will recognize that I have indeed been
				with them. </verse>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph status="onlyethiopic">
			<verse number="7">
				“Now you write this entire message which I am telling you today, because I know their defiance and their
				stubbornness (even) before I bring them into the land which I promised by oath to Abraham, Isaac,
				<pagestart p5c="005" />
				and Jacob: ‘To your posterity I will give the land which flows with milk and honey’. When they eat and are full,
			</verse>
			<verse number="8">they will turn to foreign gods—to ones which will not save them from any of their afflictions.
				Then this testimony will serve as evidence. </verse>
			<verse number="9">For they will forget all my commandments—everything that I command them—and will follow the
				nations, their impurities, and their shame. They will serve their gods, and (this) will prove an obstacle for
				them—an affliction, a pain, and a trap. </verse>
			<verse number="10">Many will be destroyed. They will be captured and will fall into the enemy’s control because
				they abandoned my statutes, my commandments, my covenantal festivals, my sabbaths, my holy things which I have
				hallowed for myself among them, my tabernacle, and my temple which I sanctified for myself in the middle of the land
				so that I could set my name on it and that it could live (there). </verse>
			<verse number="11">They made for themselves high places, (sacred) groves, and carved images; each of them
				prostrated himself before his own in order to go astray. They will sacrifice their children to demons and to every
				product (conceived by) their erring minds. </verse>
			<verse number="12">I will send witnesses to them so that I may testify to them, but they will not listen and will
				kill the witnesses. They will persecute those too who study the law diligently. They will abrogate everything and
				will begin to do evil in my presence. </verse>
			<verse number="13">
				Then I will hide my face from them. I will deliver them into the control of the nations for captivity, for
				<i>booty</i>
				, and for being devoured. I will remove them from the land and disperse them among the nations.
			</verse>
			<verse number="14">They will forget all my law, all my commandments, and all my verdicts. They will err regarding
				the beginning of the month, the sabbath, the festival, the jubilee, and the decree. </verse>

			<verse number="15">
				“After this they will return to me from among the nations with all their minds, all their souls, and all their
				strength. Then I will gather them from among all the nations, and they will search for me so that I may be found by
				them when they have searched for me with all their minds and with all their souls. I will rightly disclose to them
				abundant
				<pagestart p5c="007" />
				peace.
			</verse>
			<verse number="16">I will transform them into a righteous plant with all my mind and with all my soul. They will
				become a blessing, not a curse; they will become the head, not the tail. </verse>
			<verse number="17">I will build my temple among them and will live with them; I will become their God and they will
				become my true and righteous people. </verse>
			<verse number="18">I will neither abandon them nor become alienated from them, for I am the Lord their God.”
			</verse>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph status="onlyethiopic">
			<verse number="19">Then Moses fell prostrate and prayed and said: “Lord my God, do not allow your people and your
				heritage to go along in the error of their minds, and do not deliver them into the control of the nations with the
				result that they rule over them lest they make them sin against you. </verse>
			<verse number="20">May your mercy, Lord, be lifted over your people. Create for them a just spirit. May the spirit
				of Belial not rule over them so as to bring charges against them before you and to trap them away from every proper
				path so that they may be destroyed from your presence. </verse>
			<verse number="21">They are your people and your heritage whom you have rescued from Egyptian control by your great
				power. Create for them a pure mind and a holy spirit. May they not be trapped in their sins from now to eternity.”
			</verse>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph status="onlyethiopic">
			<verse number="22">Then the Lord said to Moses: “I know their contrary nature, their way of thinking, and their
				stubbornness. They will not listen until they acknowledge their sins and the sins of their ancestors. </verse>
			<verse number="23">After this they will return to me in a fully upright manner and with all (their) minds and all
				(their) souls. I will cut away the foreskins of their minds and the foreskins of their descendants’ minds. I will
				create a holy spirit for them and will purify them in order that they may not turn away from me from that time
				forever. </verse>
			<verse number="24">Their souls will adhere to me and to all my commandments. They will perform my commandments. I
				will become their father and they will become my children. </verse>
			<verse number="25">
				All of them will be called children of the living God. Every angel and every spirit will know them. They will know
				that they are my children and that I am their father in a just and proper way and that I love them.

			<verse number="26">“Now you write all these words which I tell you on this mountain: what is first and what is last

		<paragraph status="onlyethiopic">
			<verse number="27">Then he said to an angel of the presence: “<i>Dictate </i>

			<verse number="28">The Lord will appear in the sight of all, and all will know that I am the God of Israel, the

		</paragraph>
		<paragraph status="onlyethiopic">
			<verse number="29">The angel of the presence, who was going along in front of the Israelite camp, took the tablets

				their jubilees, year by year in their full number, and their jubilees from [the time of the creation until] the time
				of the new creation when the heavens, the earth, and all their creatures will be renewed like the powers of the sky
				and like all the creatures of the earth, until the time when the temple of the Lord will be created in Jerusalem on

	<chapter number="2" id="ch2">
		<paragraph status="onlyethiopic">
			<verse number="1">On the Lord’s orders the angel of the presence said to Moses: “Write all the words about the
				creation—how in six days the Lord God completed all his works, everything that he had created, and kept sabbath on
				the seventh day. He sanctified it for all ages and set it as a sign for all his works. </verse>
			<verse number="2">
				For on the first day he created the heavens that are above, the earth, the waters, and all the spirits who serve
				before him, namely: the angels of the presence; the angels of holiness; the angels of the spirits of fire; the
				angels of the spirits of the winds; the angels of the spirits of the clouds, of darkness,
				<i>snow</i>
				, hail, and frost; the angels of the sounds,
				<pagestart p5c="011" />
				the thunders, and the lightnings; and the angels of the spirits of cold and heat, of winter, spring, autumn, and
				summer, and of all the spirits of his creatures which are in the heavens, on earth, and in every (place). [There
				were also] the depths, darkness and light, dawn and evening which he prepared through the knowledge of his mind.
			</verse>
			<verse number="3">Then we saw his works and blessed him. We offered praise before him regarding all his works
				because he had made seven great works on the first day. </verse>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph status="onlyethiopic">
			<verse number="4">On the second day he made a firmament between the waters, and the waters were divided on that
				day. Half of them went up above and half of them went down below the firmament (which was) in the middle above the
				surface of the whole earth. This was the only work that he made on the second day. </verse>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph status="onlyethiopic">
			<verse number="5">On the third day he did as he said to the waters that they should pass from the surface of the
				whole earth to one place and that the dry land should appear. </verse>
			<verse number="6">The waters did so, as he told them. They withdrew from the surface of the earth to one place
				apart from this firmament, and dry land appeared. </verse>
			<verse number="7">
				On that day he created for them all the seas—each with the places where they collected—all the rivers, and the
				places where the waters collected in the mountains and on the whole earth; all the reservoirs, all the dew of the
				earth; the seed that is sown—with each of its kinds—all that
				<i>sprouts</i>
				, the fruit trees, the forests, and the garden of Eden (which is) in Eden for enjoyment and for
				<i>food</i>
				. These four great types he made on the third day.
			</verse>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph status="onlyethiopic">
			<verse number="8">On the fourth day the Lord made the sun, the moon, and the stars. He placed them in the heavenly

			<verse number="9">The Lord appointed the sun as a great sign above the earth for days, sabbaths, months,

			<verse number="10">
				It separates between light and darkness and (serves) for wellbeing so that everything that sprouts and grows on the

				<pagestart p5c="013" />
			</verse>
			<verse number="11">On the fifth day he created the great sea monsters within the watery depths, for these were the

				kinds. </verse>
			<verse number="12">The sun shone over them for (their) wellbeing and over everything that was on the earth—all that
				sprouts from the ground, all fruit trees, and all animate beings. These three kinds he made on the fifth day.
			</verse>

		<paragraph status="onlyethiopic">
			<verse number="13">On the sixth day he made all the land animals, all cattle, and everything that moves about on

			<verse number="14">After all this, he made mankind—as one man and a woman he made them. He made him rule everything
				on earth and in the seas and over flying creatures, animals, cattle, everything that moves about on the earth, and
				the entire earth. Over all these he made him rule. These four kinds he made on the sixth day. </verse>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph status="onlyethiopic">
			<verse number="15">The total was 22 kinds. </verse>
			<verse number="16">He finished all his works on the sixth day: everything in heaven, on the earth, in the seas, in
				the depths, in the light, in the darkness, and in every place. </verse>
			<verse number="17">He gave us the sabbath day as a great sign so that we should perform work for six days and that
				we should keep sabbath from all work on the seventh day. </verse>
			<verse number="18">He told us—all the angels of the presence and all the angels of holiness (these two great
				kinds)—to keep sabbath with him in heaven and on earth. </verse>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph status="onlyethiopic">
			<verse number="19">He said to us: ‘I will now separate a people for myself from among my nations. They, too, will

				sanctify them for myself; in this way I will bless them. They will become my people and I will become their God.
			</verse>
			<verse number="20">I have chosen the descendants of Jacob among all of those whom I have seen. I have recorded them
				as my first-born son and have sanctified them for myself throughout the ages of eternity. I will tell them about the

			<verse number="21">
				In this way he made a sign on it by which they, too, would keep sabbath with us on the

			<verse number="23">There were 22 leaders of humanity from Adam until him; and 22 kinds of works were made until the

			<verse number="24">It was granted to these that for all times they should be the blessed and holy ones of the

			<verse number="1">On the sixth day of the second week we brought to Adam, on the Lord’s orders, all animals, all
				cattle, all birds, everything that moves about on the earth, and everything that moves about in the water—in their
				various kinds and various forms: the animals on the first day; the cattle on the second day; the birds on the third
				day; everything that moves about on the earth on the fourth day; and the ones that move about in the water on the
				fifth day. </verse>
			<verse number="2">Adam named them all, each with its own name. Whatever he called them became their name. </verse>
			<verse number="3">During these five days Adam was looking at all of these—male and female among every kind that
				was on the earth. But he himself was alone; there was no one whom he found for himself who would be for him a helper
				who was like him. </verse>
			<verse number="4">Then the Lord said to us: ‘It is not good that the man should be alone. Let us make him a helper
				who is like him’. </verse>
			<verse number="5">The Lord our God imposed a sound slumber on him and he fell asleep. Then he took one of his
				bones for a woman. That rib was the origin of the woman—from among his bones. He built up the flesh in its place and
				built the woman. </verse>
			<verse number="6">
				Then he awakened Adam from his sleep. When he awoke, he got up on the sixth day. Then he brought (him) to her. He
				knew her and said to her: ‘This is now bone from my bone and flesh
				<pagestart p5c="019" />
				from my flesh. This one will be called my wife, for she was taken from her husband’.
			</verse>
			<verse number="7">For this reason a man and a woman are to become one, and for this reason he leaves his father

		</paragraph>
		<paragraph status="onlyethiopic">
			<verse number="8">In the first week Adam and his wife—the rib—were created, and in the second week he showed her

				a female two (units) of seven days. </verse>
			<verse number="9">After 40 days had come to an end for Adam in the land where he had been created, we brought him
				into the Garden of Eden to work and keep it. His wife was brought (there) on the eightieth day. After this she
				entered the Garden of Eden. </verse>
			<verse number="10">For this reason a commandment was written in the heavenly tablets for the one who gives birth to
				a child: if she gives birth to a male, she is to remain in her impurity for seven days like the first seven days;
				then for 33 days she is to remain in the blood of purification. She is not to touch any sacred thing nor to enter
				the sanctuary until she completes these days for a male. </verse>
			<verse number="11">As for a female she is to remain in her impurity for two weeks of days like the first two weeks
				and 66 days in the blood of her purification. Their total is 80 days. </verse>

			<verse number="1">
				In the sixth year of the
				<pagestart p19c="105" p5c="117" />
				seventh week of this jubilee [2057] Abraham summoned his son Isaac and gave him orders as follows: ‘I have grown old
				but do not know when I will die because I have reached the full number of my days.
			</verse>
			<verse number="2">Now I am 175 years of age. Throughout my entire lifetime I have continually remembered the Lord
				and tried to do his will wholeheartedly and to walk a straight course in all his ways. </verse>
			<verse number="3">I have personally hated idols in order to keep myself for doing the will of the one who created
				me. </verse>
			<verse number="4">For he is the living God. He is more holy, faithful, and just than anyone. With him there is no
				favoritism nor does he accept bribes because he is a just God and one who exercises judgment against all who
				transgress his commands and despise his covenant. </verse>
			<verse number="5">
				Now you, my son, keep his commandments, ordinances, and verdicts. Do not pursue unclean things, statues, or molten
				<pagestart p19c="106" p5c="118" />
				images.
			</verse>
			<verse number="6">Do not eat any blood of an animal, cattle, or of any bird that flies in the sky. </verse>
			<verse number="7">If you slaughter a victim for a peace offering that is acceptable, slaughter it and pour their
				blood onto the altar. All the fat of the sacrifice you will offer on the altar with the finest flour; and the
				offering kneaded with oil, with its libation—you will offer it all together on the altar as a sacrifice. (It is) an
				aroma that is pleasing before the Lord. </verse>
			<verse number="8">
				As you place the fat of the peace offering on the fire which is on the altar, so also
				<i>remove</i>
				the fat which is on the stomach and all the fat which is on the internal organs and the two kidneys and all the fat
				which is on them and which is on the upper thighs and liver with the kidneys.
			</verse>
			<verse number="9">All of this you will offer as a pleasant fragrance which is acceptable before the Lord, with its
				sacrifice and its libation as a pleasant fragrance—the food of the offering to the Lord. </verse>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph status="partial">
			<verse number="10">
				Eat its meat during that day and on the next day; but the sun is not to set
				<pagestart p5c="119" />
				on it on the next day until it is eaten. It is not to be left over for the third day because it is not acceptable to
				him. For it was not pleasing and is not therefore commanded. All who eat it will bring guilt on themselves because
				this is the way I found (it) written in the book of my ancestors, in the words of Enoch and the words of Noah.
			</verse>
			<verse number="11">On all your offerings you are to place salt; let the covenant of salt not come to an end on any
				of your sacrifices before the Lord. </verse>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			<verse number="12">
				Be careful about the (kinds of) woods (that are used for) sacrifice so that you bring no (kinds of) woods onto the
				altar except these only: cypress, silver-fir, almond, fir, pine, cedar, juniper,
				<i>date</i>
				, olive wood, myrtle, laurel wood, the cedar whose name is the juniper bush, and balsam.
			</verse>
			<verse number="13">Of these (kinds of) woods place beneath the sacrifice on the altar ones that have been tested
				for their appearance. Do not place (beneath it) any split or dark wood; (place there) strong (kinds of) woods and
				firm ones without any defect—a perfect and new growth. Do not place (there) old wood, for its aroma has left—because
				there is no longer an aroma upon it as at first. </verse>
			<verse number="14">Apart from these (kinds of) woods there is no other which you are to place (beneath the
				sacrifice) because their aroma is distinctive and the smell of their aroma goes up to heaven. </verse>
			<verse number="15">Pay attention to this commandment and do it, my son, so that you may behave properly in all your
				actions. </verse>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			<verse number="16">At all times be clean with respect to your body. Wash with water before you go up to make an
				offering on the altar. Wash your hands and feet before you approach the altar [or: sacrifice]. When you have
				finished making an offering, wash your hands and feet again. </verse>
			<verse number="17">No blood is to be visible on you or on your clothing. My son, be careful with blood; be very
				careful to cover it with dirt. </verse>
			<verse number="18">You are not, therefore, to consume any blood because the blood is the vital force. Do not
				consume any blood. </verse>
			<verse number="19">
				Do not take a bribe for any human blood so that it may not be shed casually—without punishment—because it is
				<pagestart p5c="121" />
				the blood that is shed which makes the earth sin. The
				<i>earth</i>
				will not be able to become pure from blood except through the blood of the one who shed it.
			</verse>
			<verse number="20">Do not take a bribe or gift for human blood; blood for blood—then it will be acceptable before
				the most high God. He will be the protection of the good; and (he will be this) so that you may be kept from every
				evil one and that he may save you from every (kind of) death. </verse>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph status="onlyethiopic">
			<verse number="21">I see, my son, that all the actions of mankind (consist of) sin and wickedness and all their
				deeds of impurity, worthlessness, and contamination. With them there is nothing that is right. </verse>
			<verse number="22">Be careful not to walk in their ways or to tread in their paths so that you may not commit a
				mortal sin before the most high God. Then he will hide his face from you and will hand you over to the power of your
				offenses. He will uproot you from the earth and your descendants from beneath heaven. Your name and descendants will
				be destroyed from the entire earth. </verse>
			<verse number="23">Depart from all their actions and from all their impurity. Keep the obligations of the most high
				God and do his will. Then you will act properly in every regard. </verse>
			<verse number="24">He will bless you in all your actions. He will raise from you a righteous plant in all the earth
				throughout all the history of the earth. Then my name and your name will not be passed over in silence beneath
				heaven throughout all time. </verse>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph status="onlyethiopic">
			<verse number="25">God in peace, my son. May the most high God—my God and your God—strengthen you to do his will.
				May he bless all your descendants—the remnant of your descendants—throughout the history of eternity with every
				proper blessing so that you may become a blessing throughout the entire earth’. </verse>

			<verse number="1">In the first week in the forty-fourth jubilee, during the second year [2109]—it is the year in
				which Abraham died—Isaac and Ishmael came from the well of the oath to their father Abraham to celebrate the

				come. </verse>
			<verse number="2">
				For
				<pagestart p19c="103" p5c="123" />
				Isaac’s possessions in Beersheba were numerous. Isaac used to go and inspect his possessions and then return to his

			</verse>
			<verse number="3">At that time Ishmael came to see his father, and all of them came together. Isaac slaughtered a
				sacrifice for the offering; he offered (it) on his father’s altar which he had made in Hebron. </verse>
			<verse number="4">He sacrificed a peace offering and prepared a joyful feast in front of his brother Ishmael.
				Rebecca made fresh bread out of new wheat. She gave it to her son Jacob to bring to his father Abraham some of the
				firstfruits of the land so that he would eat (it) and bless the Creator of everything before he died. </verse>
			<verse number="5">Isaac, too, sent through Jacob [his] excellent peace offering [and wine to his father] Abraham
				for him to eat and drink. </verse>
			<verse number="6">
				He ate and drank. Then he blessed the most high God who created the heavens and the earth, who made all the fat

			<verse number="11">So he came close and kissed him. Then he said: ‘May my son Jacob and all his sons be blessed to

			<verse number="12">Be strong before people and continue to exercise power among all of Seth’s descendants. Then

			<verse number="20">Be careful, my son Jacob, not to marry a woman from all the descendants of Canaan’s daughters,

			<verse number="3">Now Rebecca was listening as Isaac was talking to Esau. </verse>
			<verse number="4">When Esau went out early to the open country to trap (something), catch (it), and bring (it) to

			<verse number="5">Rebecca summoned her son Jacob and said to him: ‘I have just heard your father Isaac saying to

			<verse number="6">Now, therefore, listen, my son, to what I am ordering you. Go to your flock and take for me two

			<verse number="7">But Jacob said to his mother Rebecca: ‘Mother, I will not be sparing about anything that my

			</verse>
			<verse number="8">
				You know that I am smooth while my brother Esau is hairy. I will look to him like someone who does what is wrong. I

			<verse number="2">When Reuben saw Bilhah, Rachel’s maid—his father’s concubine—bathing in water in a private

			<verse number="10">For this reason it is written and ordained on the heavenly tablets that a man is not to lie with
