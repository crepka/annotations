		<verse number="8">and to lead the people into the land that was given to their fathers,</verse>

		<verse number="10">and promise to do impeccably everything that is commanded, according to your zeal.</verse>
		<verse number="11">Therefore, thus says the Lord of the world.</verse>

		<verse number="14">Therefore, he has devised and invented me, I who have been prepared from the beginning of the world to be the mediator of his covenant.</verse>
		<verse number="15">But now, I will reveal it (<i>sc.</i> the purpose of God’s creation) to you, because the time of the years of my life is fulfilled, and I win go to the resting-place of my fathers, and before the entire people ...</verse>
		<verse number="16">You, however, receive this writing, which serves to acknowledge the trustworthiness of the books which I will hand to you,</verse>

		<verse number="5">And they will cry: ‘Righteous and holy is the Lord! Truly, because you have sinned, we and our children have been carried off just like you.’</verse>
		<verse number="6">Then the ten tribes will weep, hearing the reproaches of the two tribes, and they will say:</verse>
		<verse number="7">‘What can we say to you, brethren? Has not this distress come over the entire house of Israel?’</verse>
		<verse number="8">And all tribes will weep, crying unto heaven, and saying: </verse>
		<verse number="9">‘God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, remember your covenant, which you made with them, and the oath, which you swore by yourself, that their seed would never be absent from the land that you gave to them!’</verse>

		<verse number="3">And Joshua answered him and said:</verse>
		<verse number="4">“Why do you terrify me, lord Moses, and how will I hide myself from what you have said with the bitter voice that came from your mouth, and which is full of tears and sighs, because you will presently go away from this people?</verse>

		<verse number="11">or who will pray for them, not omitting one single day, so that I can lead them into the land of the Amorites?</verse>
		<verse number="12">How will I be able to &lt;guard&gt; this people, like a father his only son, or like a woman her daughter—a virgin who is being prepared to be given to a man—, and who is anxious to protect her (<i>sc.</i> daughter’s) body from the sun and her feet from going unshod over the ground?</verse>
