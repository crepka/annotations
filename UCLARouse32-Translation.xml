				<line>and beg you through the sorrowful sword </line>
				<line>which your most blessed spirit passed through</line> 
				<line>sensing in spirit the morning hour </line>
				<line>your son was arrested, beaten, spat upon,</line>
				<line>and bound in the presence of officials and judges.</line> 
				<line>Let me, a miserable sinner, share </line>

				<line>the salvation of all both living and dead.</line>
				<line>I entreat you Lord through the same sacred</line>
				<line>and life-giving mystery of your body and</line>
				<line>blood by which daily in your church</line>
				<line>we are fed and and given drink, we are washed and sanctified,</line>
				<line>and so in one most high divinity </line>
				<line>we are caused to partake, give me your holy virtues </line>
				<line>by which a good conscience having been refilled </line>
				<line>I might draw near to your altar, so that these heavenly</line>
				<line>sacraments will effect in me salvation</line>
				<line>and life. With your own sacred and blessed mouth you have said:</line>
				<line>The bread which I give is my flesh </line>
				<line>for the life the of the world. One who eats me</line>
				<line>will live because of me and that one remains in me</line>
				<line>and I in him. I am the living bread which descended from heaven.</line>
				<line>Whoever eats of this </line>
				<line>bread will live forever. Sweetest bread,</line>
				<line>heal the palate of my heart so that I might feel</line>
				<line>the sweetness of your love. Heal it from every</line>
				<line>sickness so that it might feel no sweetness except you, </line>
				<line>seek no love except you, love no beau[ty] except you</line>
